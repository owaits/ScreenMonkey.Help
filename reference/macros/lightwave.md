# LightwaveRF

LightwaveRF is a home lighting automation control protocol which allows control of light dimmers, relays and power sockets. Its applications go beyond home use and could be used for raising and lowering screens or anywhere where control of low power (13A) devices is required. To use this macro you must purchased a LightwaveRF Wifi router which connects to the same IP network as Screen Monkey.

Using this macro you can change light dimmer levels, select pre-configured moods and turn 13A Sockets On or Off. A relay unit is also available.

Once you add the macro it can be incorporated into your normal Screen Monkey show. Your can test the command has been setup correctly by clicking on the 'Try Command' button.

To setup your LightwaveRF devices please visit the LightwaveRF website.
